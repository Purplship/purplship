# Karrio Product Requirements Document

Below is an Initial Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Karrio that consolidates the full scope of the project (Core OSS, Insiders, and Cloud). This document is meant to serve as a foundation and guide for the ongoing development. The ultimate goal is to place this PRD (and subsequent refined PRDs) in a dedicated documentation folder to improve AI-based coding assistance and to streamline the development process.

## 1. Document Overview

- Document Title: Karrio Full Scope PRD (Core OSS, Insiders, and Cloud)
- Version: 1.0 (Initial Draft)
- Last Updated: ￼
- Authors: Karrio Team

### Objective

The purpose of this PRD is to:

1. Provide a clear product vision for Karrio's open-source core, Insiders features, and Karrio Cloud.
2. Define the requirements for each product scope (OSS, Insiders, Cloud).
3. Outline the goals, key features, and architectural considerations.
4. Serve as a living document that can be refined, updated, and expanded to speed up development and provide clarity.

Karrio is a multi-carrier shipping API and platform that consolidates different shipping carriers (e.g., UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL, and more) into a single, standardized API interface. It aims to provide eCommerce retailers, logistics operators, and developers with:

- Unified Shipping Workflows: Rate calculation, label generation, shipment tracking, and carrier services in one place.
- Scalable Integrations: A plugin-based architecture that allows easy extension and addition of new carriers.
- Flexible Deployment: Available as open-source (self-hosted) and as a fully managed cloud offering.

### Karrio Core (OSS)

The Core OSS repository is open-source and includes:

- Carrier integrations (official open-source ones).
- Core API endpoints for rating, label generation, tracking, and address validation.
- Plugin architecture enabling custom extensions, community contributions, and advanced capabilities.

### Karrio Insiders

Karrio Insiders is a premium tier built on top of the Core OSS that includes:

- Advanced or exclusive carrier integrations beyond the official open-source ones.
- Priority updates & SLAs for critical fixes and enhancements.
- Optimized performance features (e.g., caching layers or advanced analytics).
- Commercial licensing and enterprise-level support.

### Karrio Cloud

Karrio Cloud is a SaaS offering of Karrio that:

- Hosts the Karrio platform for users who prefer a managed solution.
- Provides subscription management, usage tracking, and scaling capabilities.

### 7.2 Tech Stack Considerations

- Backend: Python-based (e.g., FastAPI or Django) or Node.js.
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for standard shipping data; Redis for caching.
- Queue System: (Optional) RabbitMQ, Celery, or similar for background tasks.
- Infrastructure: Docker containers, Kubernetes for Cloud deployment.
- Plugin System: Python packages with well-defined interfaces (if Python-based).

## 8. Development Plan and Milestones

1. MVP for Core OSS
   - Rating, label generation, tracking for at least 2-3 carriers (e.g., USPS, UPS, FedEx).
   - Basic plugin architecture documented.

2. Karrio Insiders Launch
   - Add advanced carriers (e.g., DHL Express, specialized carriers).
   - Introduce subscription checks and license enforcement in the codebase.

3. Karrio Cloud Beta
   - Deployment environment for the cloud.
   - Set up user management, billing integration, and basic analytics dashboard.

4. Production-Ready Cloud
   - Harden security, finalize billing, ensure high availability.
   - Launch advanced analytics, usage dashboards, and enterprise compliance.

## 9. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Unit & Integration Tests: Each feature and carrier plugin must have coverage of core scenarios.
- End-to-End Tests: Validate the entire flow (rate → label → track) across carriers in both OSS and Cloud.
- Performance Tests: Benchmark response times for rating and label generation.
- Security Assessments: Especially for Karrio Cloud (multi-tenant), ensure data isolation and compliance.

## 10. Risks and Mitigations

1. Carrier API Changes
   - Risk: Carriers update their APIs frequently.
   - Mitigation: Flexible plugin approach and versioned integrations.

2. Scaling for Cloud
   - Risk: High usage spikes causing slowdowns.
   - Mitigation: Container orchestration (K8s) with auto-scaling and efficient caching.

3. Open-Source Maintenance
   - Risk: Community contributions might break backward compatibility.
   - Mitigation: Strict code reviews, robust CI pipeline, versioned plugin interfaces.

4. Revenue & Support
   - Risk: Balancing free OSS community with premium features.
   - Mitigation: Clearly delineate features in OSS vs. Insiders, provide strong community support, maintain a well-defined upgrade path.

## 11. Documentation and Deployment

- Documentation Folder Structure
  - PRD.md

- AI-Assisted Development
  - Ensure the PRDs, code references, and architectural diagrams are accessible so that AI IDE tools (like Cursor) can provide context-aware suggestions.

## 12. Next Steps

1. Review & Feedback
   - Gather input from all stakeholders (engineering, product, community) to refine requirements.

2. Roadmap Finalization
   - Prioritize features for the next 1-2 quarters, especially for Insiders and Cloud expansions.

3. Implementation & Iteration
   - Start developing MVP components following the outlined architecture and plugin system.

4. Publish Documentation
   - Continuously update the docs/prd/ folder with refined PRDs, ensuring AI-based tools have the latest context.
